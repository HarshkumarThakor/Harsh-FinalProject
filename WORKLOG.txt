->  The day when i created database and solved the errors and learn new code from google.
    The biggest error i was facing was that my downloading image was slow and output was showing 1st.So the data where not syncing.
    I used async function which means it will always return a promise. (DOWNLOAD APOD IMAGE - kept async so it would always wait for image to download than show the output)
    Learn how to define async and end it with main as asyncio.run(main())
    Got error in database where i used hexdigest() fpr SHA256 to return it as string and fetch as hexadecimal digits.
